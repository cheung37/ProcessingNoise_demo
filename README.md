# ProcessingNoise_demo
&emsp;&emsp;Demonstrate how to use iterative training and feedback mechanisms to address label noise issues.
&emsp;&emsp;Three sets of control experiments were conducted to compare the performance of no retraining with noisy data, retraining with noise data plus original data, and retraining with noisy data.
&emsp;&emsp;The deep learning framework is the most basic framework built in Xiaotudui deep learning. The task is image classification.
&emsp;&emsp;The three codes inside are roughly the same, with some slight changes to achieve the effect of a controlled experiment.
&emsp;&emsp;The folder contains pictures of the loss function and accuracy, experimental code and tensorboard visualization files, as well as output about performance.
&emsp;&emsp;This is just a very simple example of how to use feedback mechanisms to deal with noise issues in iterative training.

&emsp;&emsp;演示如何使用迭代训练和反馈机制来解决标签噪声问题。
&emsp;&emsp;进行了三组对照实验，比较不对噪声数据再训练、对噪声数据加原始数据再训练、对噪声数据再训练的性能。
&emsp;&emsp;深度学习框架是小土堆深度学习构建的最基本的框架，任务是图像分类。
&emsp;&emsp;里面的三段代码大致相同，稍作改动，达到对照实验的效果。
&emsp;&emsp;该文件夹包含损失函数和准确率的图片、实验代码和tensorboard可视化文件，以及有关性能的输出。
&emsp;&emsp;这只是一个非常简单的例子，说明如何在迭代训练中使用反馈机制来处理噪声问题。
